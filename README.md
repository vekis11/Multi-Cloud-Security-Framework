# Multi-Cloud Security Framework

## Author
**Built by:** Vekis Tem  
**Project:** Multi-Cloud Security Framework  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive security monitoring and incident response across AWS, Azure, and GCP

---

## Overview

The Multi-Cloud Security Framework is a comprehensive, automated security solution designed to provide unified security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response across multiple cloud providers. In today's hybrid and multi-cloud environments, organizations face the challenge of maintaining consistent security postures across different cloud platforms, each with their own native security tools and APIs.

This framework addresses these challenges by providing a centralized, automated approach to security management that works seamlessly across AWS, Azure, and GCP.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this framework is to:

1. **Unify Security Monitoring**: Provide a single pane of glass for security monitoring across multiple cloud providers
2. **Automate Compliance**: Ensure consistent compliance with security standards (CIS, NIST, SOC 2, etc.) across all cloud environments
3. **Detect Threats**: Leverage native cloud security services while providing additional correlation and analysis
4. **Respond to Incidents**: Automate incident response and remediation actions across cloud boundaries
5. **Reduce Manual Overhead**: Minimize the need for manual security monitoring and response tasks

## How It Solves Real-World Problems

### Problem 1: Security Tool Fragmentation
**Challenge**: Organizations using multiple cloud providers often have fragmented security tools, making it difficult to maintain a unified security posture.

**Solution**: This framework provides a centralized approach to security management while leveraging each cloud provider's native security services. The shared aggregator correlates findings from all clouds, providing a single view of security status.

### Problem 2: Manual Security Operations
**Challenge**: Security teams spend significant time manually monitoring multiple cloud environments, leading to delayed threat detection and response.

**Solution**: Automated monitoring and response capabilities reduce manual overhead. The framework continuously monitors all cloud environments and can automatically respond to common security incidents.

### Problem 3: Compliance Complexity
**Challenge**: Maintaining compliance across multiple cloud providers requires understanding different compliance frameworks and consistently implementing controls.

**Solution**: The framework implements standardized compliance monitoring across all cloud providers, ensuring consistent adherence to security standards regardless of the underlying cloud platform.

### Problem 4: Incident Response Delays
**Challenge**: Security incidents often go undetected or unresponded to due to a lack of visibility across cloud boundaries.

**Solution**: Real-time threat detection and automated incident response capabilities ensure quick identification and remediation of security issues.

### Problem 5: Resource Management
**Challenge**: Managing security resources across multiple clouds requires different tools and processes for each provider.

**Solution**: Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) provides consistent resource management across all cloud providers, reducing complexity and ensuring consistency.
